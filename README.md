# Sorting Algorithms

This is a repository for sorting algorithms I wrote and played around with as additional exercise for WIA2005 - Algorithm Design and Analysis.

These algorithms were either written from understanding (and hence may have inaccuracies or can be implemented in a more efficient manner) or based on provided pseudocodes during lectures.

Future ideas for this repository include enhancing the algorithms and documentation on the algorithms as a method to further understanding.

# Algorithms Currently Implemented (Iterative)

- Bubble Sort (Two versions, one based on a previous Data Structure course and one based on a current Algorithm Design and Analysis course)
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort (Slightly works but has caveats for when a number is a multiple of 10, eg. 20,30,40 - has problems with bucket generation)
- Shell Sort
- Radix Sort (Use v2 as the first version is a hacked together method that does not properly work)
- Insertion Sort (Two versions, 1 from DS and another from Algo)
